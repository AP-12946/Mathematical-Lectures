(P.S. I know no one would care enough to do so but I'll still put it here: please ask for permission if you want to share the documents)
This series of documents aims to give you some ideas of the mathematical tools in DSE M2, advanced physics and more. The contents of current and future documents are listed below:
  1. Vector arithmetic and manipulation
  2. Differentiation
  3. Integration
  4. Application of vectors in physics
  5. More about vector functions (I)
  6. Set language
  7. Matrices and linear transformations
  8. Multivariable functions
  9. The complex plane
  10. More about vector functions (II)
  11. The nabla operator and Maxwell's Equations

      
You are encouraged to find exercises to apply these skills in your M2 textbook, or to reformluate the equations in your physics textbooks with the language of calculus.
